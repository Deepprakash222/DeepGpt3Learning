## Overview

- Interactive assistant for writing is one of the essential references any writer is willing to have to find a new idea. Usually, writers search on the internet, read other articles, or watch an event to have an idea of what they can write about to attract their readers.

- It is really hard to find a way to grasp an idea to write about – it is even harder to find something that would interest you to do that.

- Most of us know 1, or 2, or 3 famous writers as maximum, who had a difficult life finding their way to an audience.
Therefore, we are bringing to you today this interactive assistant that would facilitate this problem for you and be capable of thinking out of the box with you to bring out the best content it can be.
